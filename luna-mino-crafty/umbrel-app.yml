  Crafty Controller is a free and open-source Minecraft launcher and manager that allows users to start and administer Minecraft servers from a user-friendly interface.


  The interface runs as a self-hosted web server that is accessible to devices on your local network by default and can be port forwarded to provide external access. Crafty is designed to be easy to install and use, requiring only basic technical knowledge to get started.


  Features:


  - Create and manage multiple Minecraft servers

  - Web-based control panel

  - Server scheduling and automation

  - Backup and restore functionality

  - Live console access

  - Player management

  - Mod and plugin support


  Default Credentials:


  Check the app logs on first startup to find your default admin credentials. You can view the credentials file by accessing the app's data directory at: data/config/default-creds.txt


  We highly recommend changing the default password immediately after your first login!
